## SUPPLIO

**"85% of food that isn't used in a restuarant is thrown out."**

We started this project to solve this problem. Our hack allows food stall and restaurant owners/managers to track the stock of their ingredients, get recommendations on how much ingredients are required based on data and to automatically order ingredients from their supplier every month or when it goes below a set threshold. By using data to track inventory in the kitchen, it helps to minimize food wastage in restaurants especially when ingredients expire and cannot be used anymore.
